      <h2>Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location<h2>
      <p>We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>
      <br>

  <article>
    <h3>PART-TIME CONSULTANTS</h3>
    <p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.</span></p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>ADVICE ON RETAINER</h3>
    <p>At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>REMOTE CONSULTANTS</h3>
    <p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.</p>
  <article>

<div class="table2">
  <article>
    <h3>SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS</h3>
    <p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s specific needs.</span></p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>COST-FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS</h3>
    <p>Whether you’d like to commit to an hourly contract or fixed-fee pricing, we offer a variety of options that allow you to meet your budget requirements. For example, in some cases, a junior consultant may be exactly what you need.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>CUSTOM PROJECT SOLUTIONS</h3>
    <p>If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a consultant work on a trial-basis.</p>
